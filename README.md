This is an extremely basic finite element engine for .Net / C#.  This project was developed initially as a learning exercise for larger finite element engine project that I never had time to finish.  The main goal of this project was to create an experimental finite element engine for the .Net platform.  

My personal goal is to contribute to a stable finite element engine for the .Net platform which supports truss elements, frames, beams, shells, and solids for linear and non-linear analysis.
